# Chaotic System
Code in Python 3 to solve chaotic dynamics systems as Lorenz and Rossler.

This kind of systems, for determinated parameters, has non-peridioc dynamics. In this case, we can do some analyses varying thats parameters.

In this estudy, was developed an code to solve chaotic system numerycally, in specific for the Rossler System, but it can be easily change to others systems like Lorenz.

As a matter of fact, the objects of estudy here is to visualize the biffurcation diagram, graph of Lyapunov Expoent (both depending on the variation of the parameter b of the Rossler System) and the Strage Acttator, for parameters that turn the positive Lyapunov Expoent, which implies in a dynamic with chaotic behavior.

Bellow are some of the output of the code.
