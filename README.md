# Chaotic System
Code in Python 3 to solve chaotic dynamics systems as Lorenz and Rossler.

This kind of systems, for determinated parameters, has non-peridioc dynamics. In this case, we can do some analyses varying thats parameters.

In this estudy, was developed an code to solve chaotic system numerycally, in specific for the Rossler System, but it can be easily change to others systems like Lorenz.

As a matter of fact, the objects of estudy here is to visualize the biffurcation diagram, graph of Lyapunov Exponent (both depending on the variation of the parameter b of the Rossler System) and the Strage Acttator, for parameters that turn the Lyapunov Exponent positive, which implies in a dynamic with chaotic behavior.

One of the code outputs below for the rossler system with parameters a = 0.2, b = 0.5 and c = 5.7.
